- **Automated WhatsApp Messaging**: Integrated with PyWhatKit for seamless message delivery.
- **Customizable Reload Intervals**: Adjust page reload frequency.
- **Headless Mode**: Option to run the browser in headless mode.
- **Robust Exception Handling**: Prevents duplicate messages by leveraging a predefined exception set.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Playwright
- PyWhatKit

### Tested On

- Python 3.10.4
- macOS Sonoma 14.6

## Setup and Installation

To set up and use this script, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/kumarsomeshunos/timesnow-live-with-whatsapp.git

# Run the script
python script.py
```

## Configuration

Modify these constants in the script for your specific needs:

- `URL`: The webpage URL to scrape.
- `LOAD_TIMEOUT`: Timeout duration for page loading (in milliseconds).
- `HEADLESS`: Set to `True` for headless browser mode.
- `CLASSNAME`: The CSS class used to identify target elements on the page.
- `WHATSAPP_NUMBER`: The recipient's WhatsApp number.
- `MESSAGE_PREFIX`: Prefix added to each message.
- `RELOAD_AFTER`: Time interval (in seconds) before reloading the page.
- `RELOAD_RANDOMNESS`: Random variation (in seconds) added to the reload interval.

> **NOTE:** The target webpage's CSS class names may change frequently. Ensure you update the `CLASSNAME` constant with the latest value before running the script. Attached below is an image for your reference. (`CLASSNAME` in that image is `_3tRg`)
